        <p class="list-inst">- Known issue: once data is entered in either L1 or L2 level subitems and user add additional subitem in any level, data that has already been entered is cleared and you need to enter it again.</p>
        <p class="list-inst">- Known issue: removing added suitemn line is not possible. If you would like to decrease the number of subitems in your product structure you shall press 'Start Again' button that will clear all input entered so far.</p>
        <p class="list-inst">- Null/Zero values are prohibited as quantity or production time entry - MRP will identify them as issues during save and will ask to edit again.</p>
